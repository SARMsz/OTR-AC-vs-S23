<h1>OTR-AC vs S23 – Which SARM Hits Harder? My Real Results</h1>

<p>If you're trying to decide between <strong>OTR-AC</strong> and <strong>S23</strong>, you’re in the right place. I’ve tested both compounds solo across different cycles—cutting, recomposition, and even strength blocks. In this guide, I’ll break down exactly how they performed for me, which one is stronger, and what you should expect from each.</p>

<p>Both of these are known to be <strong>highly potent SARMs</strong>, but they work very differently. One has an acetate ester for better absorption, the other is one of the most suppressive SARMs out there. Keep reading and I’ll give it to you straight—based on my personal use, not just theory.</p>

<h2>OTR-AC (Ostarine-O-Acetate) – Better Than MK-2866?</h2>

<p><strong>OTR-AC</strong> is basically a <strong>modified version of Ostarine</strong> with an acetate ester attached. This helps it absorb faster and hit harder. I ran it at <strong>20mg/day for 6 weeks</strong> during a recomp phase to test how it compares to regular MK-2866.</p>

<h3>My Results on OTR-AC:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Faster results than Ostarine (felt it by Day 3)</li>
  <li>Dry, lean muscle gain – about 4 lbs by week 6</li>
  <li>Joints felt great (like with MK-2866)</li>
  <li>Strength gains on par with RAD140-lite</li>
  <li>No bloat, no estrogen-like side effects</li>
</ul>

<p>The main thing I noticed was how <strong>fast it kicked in</strong>. Pumps came in hard around the first week and stayed solid. It had that same “joint healing” effect that Ostarine is known for, but with stronger anabolic action. No suppression symptoms at 20mg either.</p>

<p><strong>✅ Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Faster acting than regular MK-2866</li>
  <li>Dry muscle gains – no water retention</li>
  <li>Joint support still noticeable</li>
  <li>Zero side effects for me</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>❌ Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Not as powerful as S23</li>
  <li>More expensive than MK-2866</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Best For:</strong> Recomp, Cutting, First-Time Users</p>

<h2>S23 – The Hardest Hitting SARM I’ve Tried</h2>

<p><strong>S23</strong> is a different beast. It’s not beginner-friendly, and it’s definitely not mild. This stuff is <strong>dry, powerful, and suppressive</strong. I used it during a mini-cut at <strong>15mg/day for 5 weeks</strong> and the results were aggressive—both the good and the bad.</p>

<h3>My Results on S23:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Super hard, grainy look by Week 2</li>
  <li>Extreme fat loss with muscle preservation</li>
  <li>Crazy vascularity and definition</li>
  <li>Noticeable suppression (libido dipped hard after Week 3)</li>
  <li>No estrogen sides, but slight aggression increase</li>
</ul>

<p>This stuff gets you dry and peeled fast. It’s honestly the <strong>closest thing to Winstrol</strong> I’ve ever tried, but without the liver toxicity. However, the suppression is real. You’ll need a PCT. I used Nolva for 4 weeks post-cycle and bounced back fine.</p>

<p><strong>✅ Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Best SARM for cutting and fat loss</li>
  <li>Hard, dry muscle look</li>
  <li>Preserves strength while cutting</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>❌ Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Highly suppressive</li>
  <li>Can increase aggression if not monitored</li>
  <li>Not for beginners</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Best For:</strong> Cutting, Pre-Photoshoot, Experienced Users</p>

<p>If you want clean gains with mild side effects, go for <strong>OTR-AC</strong>. It’s like Ostarine but upgraded. If you’re prepping for a cut or trying to look dry and shredded fast—and you’re okay with suppression—<strong>S23 hits way harder</strong>.</p>

<h2>How I Test SARMs</h2>

<p>My testing protocol stays the same every time so I can actually compare results. Here's what I track:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bodyweight and lean mass (weekly)</li>
  <li>Strength numbers in major lifts</li>
  <li>Visual changes (vascularity, hardness)</li>
  <li>Side effects like suppression, mood, libido</li>
</ul>

<p>I don’t stack during testing cycles so I can isolate the results of each compound. Bloodwork is done before and after to check suppression and liver enzymes.</p>

<h2>FAQs – OTR-AC vs S23</h2>

<h3>Is S23 stronger than OTR-AC?</h3>
<p>Yes. S23 is more anabolic and more suppressive. OTR-AC is a milder compound but still effective for cutting and recomp.</p>

<h3>Do I need a PCT after OTR-AC?</h3>
<p>Not usually. Most users report no suppression at 20mg/day, but bloodwork is still recommended.</p>

<h3>Does S23 burn fat?</h3>
<p>Yes. It’s one of the best SARMs for cutting fat while maintaining muscle mass.</p>

<h3>Can you stack them together?</h3>
<p>You could, but I wouldn’t recommend stacking two SARMs unless you’ve run them solo first. Start with one and assess how your body reacts.</p>

<h3>Where do I get legit OTR-AC and S23?</h3>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><strong>OTR-AC</strong> is a smarter, cleaner choice for most people. It gives you faster gains than normal Ostarine and supports your joints too. If you’re cutting or recomping, it’s a solid pick.</p>

<p><strong>S23</strong> is for the hardcore. It’ll get you cut and vascular fast, but suppression is almost guaranteed. Only run it if you’re experienced and ready for a proper PCT.</p>

<p>Whichever one you choose, track your progress, run bloods, and respect the cycle. I’ll keep testing and updating results for the community—so stay tuned.</p>
